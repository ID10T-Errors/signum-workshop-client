Please follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for any JavaScript and the [Airbnb CSS Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/css) for any CSS. HTML should follow these simple rules:

1.  Always use 2-space soft tabs

     Example:

    ```html
    <article>
      Insert words here.
      <figure>
        <img src="image" />
        <figcaption>
          Caption
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </article>
    ```

2.  Always use `/>` at the end of any tags without a closing tag.

    Example:

    ```html
    <img src="image" />
    ```

3.  Always have a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the top of the page.

    This is the only exception to rule #2.

    Example:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      ...contents...
    </html>
    ```
